# Ruby_the_Bouncer

* Write a method called check_age that is called every time the script is run

* When I run bouncer.rb I would like it to ask my age. It then tells me what I can do based on my age

* If I am younger than 18, I can do nothing

* If I am older than 18, I can vote

* If I am older than 18, I can smoke

* If I am older than 21, I can drink

* If I am older than 25, I can rent a car
